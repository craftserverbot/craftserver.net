## Sidebar feeds and components

In order to give you the information you want to know at a glance, we're introducing the sidebar feed! True to its name, it lives in your Discord server's sidebar in the form of a voice channel.

Like other status feeds, they display information about your Minecraft server and can be created and deleted with CraftServer's feed command: `/feed create sidebar-feed`.

When creating this type of status feed, you will choose a *component* for your sidebar feed. This is our way of letting you customize the information displayed to your server members! The example above is an example of the **Player count** component, but there are also several others:

- **Player count**: See how many players are online at any given time.
- **Player count / limit**: Compare your player count to your server's maximum player limit.
- **Online status**: Check if your server is currently online and joinable.
- **Ping latency**: Monitor how much time it takes for CraftServer to connect to your server and how fast your server is running.

*Pro Tip: Remove Connect permissions from the voice channel that CraftServer creates to keep server members from talking in it.*

## Statistics on Discord bot lists

CraftServer is now posting server count statistics to unofficial Discord bot lists, including [Top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/1044791133416464384) and [Discordlist](https://discordlist.gg/bot/1044791133416464384). In case you didn't know, you can also find us on the official [Discord App Directory](https://discord.com/application-directory/1044791133416464384).

If you're ever struck with a burning curiosity about how many Discord servers use CraftServer, you'll now know right where to look!

## Bedrock support

This one is a big win! Up until this point, we've only supported Java Edition because it's run by a lot of small servers. However, Bedrock Edition is the most popular and accessible by far. And CraftServer now supports viewing your Bedrock servers!

The `/view` and `/feed create` CraftServer commands now have a "bedrock" option that you can enable to view a Bedrock server:

![True/False bedrock option selected on the view slash command](/src/assets/bedrock-option.png)

You can also press the "Switch to Bedrock" button after running the view slash command. It's there at the bottom of the image below!

If you'd like some servers to test on, you can try out the [servers featured by Mojang](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Featured_servers). Happy Bedrock-ing!

## Last updated time in server info

This one is for you Discord mobile users out there! CraftServer now shows the date and time at which a server was pinged so you can be sure the information's up-to-date. This is especially useful for edit feeds because Mobile Discord doesn't show the time they were last updated!
