Hello! Thank you for using CraftServer and taking the time to read our Privacy Policy. This document describes how we handle the data you provide to us (the developers of CraftServer) while using CraftServer websites, services, Discord bots, and other products (the "Services"). We take privacy seriously; feel free to email us with any questions you have at <bot@craftserver.net>.

If you use the Services or add them to your Discord guild, you agree to the collection and use of information under the terms of this policy, so make sure you read it carefully.

## What data do we handle?

We handle any data that you directly provide to us through methods such as bot commands or forms, as well as some data that you provide indirectly, such as anonymous analytics data. We also handle any data provided to us by third parties such as Discord, including, but not limited to IDs, usernames, channel names, and permissions.

## What data do we store?

To provide our Services to you and others, improve and evaluate the effectiveness of the Services, and provide support to our users, we store:

1. Discord IDs, including webhook, message, channel, and guild IDs
2. Server addresses, ports, and hashes of information that third-party servers provide to us
3. Anonymous analytics data

## How long do we store your data?

Your information is stored until you or your guild's admin manually deletes it. If you remove the Services from your Discord guild, your information will be preserved. If you are an admin and would like some or all of your guild's data to be deleted, contact us using the information below.

## Who can access my data?

We do not sell your data or share any personally identifying information we have access to. We may share your data with third parties in certain situations, for example, to allow them to:

- facilitate our Services;
- provide the Services on our behalf;
- perform work related to the Services; or
- assist us in analyzing how the Services are used.

## Error data collection

In case of an unexpected error in the Services, we collect extra data to aid us in diagnosing and preventing unwanted behavior in the future. This information may include:

1. Your Discord username, user ID, and guild ID
2. The action you were performing when the error happened
3. An error message

You will likely be notified of the incident if it disrupts your access to the Services. This extra data will be kept for up to 90 days.

## Links to other sites

The Services may contain links to websites that are not operated by us. We advise you to review their Privacy Policies. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Contact us

If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <bot@craftserver.net>. You may also join our Discord support server using the links at the top and bottom of this website.
