Hello! Thank you for using CraftServer and taking the time to read these Terms of Service (the "Terms"). This document describes the conditions that govern your use of CraftServer websites, services, Discord bots, and other products (the "Services"). These Terms are an agreement between you and the developers of CraftServer ("we"/"us"). Feel free to email us with any questions you have at <bot@craftserver.net>.

By using the Services or adding them to your Discord guild, these Terms will automatically apply to you, so make sure you read them carefully.

## Your usage of the Services

You agree not to use the Services or contribute content to the Services in a way that:

1. infringes on other's intellectual property rights
2. violates any law or regulation
3. violates the Discord Terms of Service
4. phishes for other's private information (e.g. passwords or login codes)
5. provides you with unauthorized access to someone's computer system
6. negatively interferes with the experience of other users
7. copies, modifies, decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of the Services, any part of the Services, or our trademarks.

You're not allowed to make derivative versions, such as a version in a different language. Any violation of the above is grounds for termination of your use of or access to the Services. The Services themselves, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to them, still belong to us.

## Changes to the Services

We are committed to ensuring that the Services are as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to, at any time and for any reason, make changes to the Services, charge for your access to them, discontinue any part of them, or impose limits on them. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

## On the subject of your security

We store and process personal data that you have provided to us (your "Data") to provide the Services. It’s your responsibility to keep your devices with access to the Services secure. If your Discord account is compromised, attackers may be able to access, view, and modify your Data.

## Changes to the Terms

We may update our Terms from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the updated Terms on this page.

## Our liability

The Services are provided "as is" and we disclaim all warranties with regard to them including all implied warranties of merchantability and fitness. In no event shall we be liable for any special, direct, indirect, or consequential damages or any damages whatsoever resulting from loss of use, data, or profits, whether in an action of contract, negligence, or other tortious action, arising out of or in connection with the use or performance of the Services.
